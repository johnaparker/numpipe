dependency:
    * allow dependency for instanaces
    * If B depends on A, and A throws an error.... do something
    * if A is rerun, then rerun B if B depends on A, unless --no-dependency flag is specified 
    * more sophisticated tree dependency checking
    * implicit dependencies using job.load

notifications
    * if a traceback occurs before any plots get made in @plots, open an empty figure that won't get notified to check for idle
    * notifications of simulation finishing when there is no @plots
    * RCC: can we add a single python --at-end call that runs after all others have finished? (runs with --no-show and --no-delay)
    * deal with multiple @plots

* save animations in parallel (each process needs to call the undecorated @plots function to generate its respective animation)

* command-line save figure options: file format (svg, pdf, etc.), dpi, bbox_inches, etc.

* parallel execution with a single h5 file (not add_instance)

* h5cache: max_memory across all npcaches, npcaches need to concatenate some minimum size

* defer load option to read only part of the h5file
