dependency:
    * allow dependency for instanaces
    * If B depends on A, and A throws an error.... do something
    * more sophisticated tree dependency checking
    * implicit dependencies using job.load

parallel execution with a single h5 file (not add_instance)

experiment with Telegram bot 
    * plot-related command line arguments (--no-show, --no-delay, --show fig_number, --pdf_pages, --save, --theme {dark})
    * RCC: can we add a single python --at-end call that runs after all others have finished? (runs with --no-show and --no-delay)
    * deal with multiple @plots

h5cache: max_memory across all npcaches, npcaches need to concatenate some minimum size

defer load option to read only part of the h5file
